The sqlpp11 connector for sqlite3 has additional functions:

  - auto attach(const connection_config&, const std::string name) -> schema_t;
  - auto set_default_isolation_level(isolation_level level) -> void;
  - auto get_default_isolation_level() -> isolation_level;

While these functions are probably too specific, it would be good to offer the ability to execute arbitrary strings and obtain results from that.
Also for other connectors.

Drop multi_column. It makes a lot of things horribly complex (like result binding, or how to treat a result row as a tuple (e.g. is it a flat tuple or a nested one))? It probably never worked for prepared statements in sqlpp11, and it is for a super duper edge case only.

Results of prepared statements:
===============================
There are two types:
  - mysql and sqlite3 allow just one result per statement.
  - postgresql allows any number of results per statement (results can outlive the prepared statement or even the connection)

sqlite3 requires the prepare-step.

Plan:
=====
               Direct                                             Prepared
    mysql      result object                                      result object that refers to the prepared statement
               (there can be multiple per connection)             (there can be only one at a time and it cannot outlive the
                                                                   prepared statement, which cannot outlive the connection)
    sqlite3    result object that stores                          result object that just refers to the prepared statement
               the prepared statement                             (there can be only one at a time and it cannot outlive the
               (there can be only one live result per connection   prepared statement, which cannot outlive the connection)
    postgresql result object                                      result object
               (can outlive the connection)                       (can outlive the connection)

Actually, the more I think about this:
Maybe `prepared_statement` should not be a real thing in sqlpp17. It could be more of a concept (or maybe a metaclass in C++23).
Results generally could not be things in sqlpp17. The current required ping-pong between sqlpp and the connector is pretty hard to trace.


debugging every bound value is nonsense

The connection doe not hold on to the config. Thus, it cannot call a callback in the destructor

(posix reserves _t suffixes)

Get rid of the string-execute. Add some string-to-statement-function

sqlite3 cannot bind NaN to double.


multi-line inserts require at least one line. That is part of the contract. The library is not required to do the check.
If the user provides zero lines, it is a usage error.

float:
=====
need a way to deal with NaN or +-inf.

This is really annoying.
MySQL does not have support for non-finite values.
sqlite3 accepts anything in any column, including strings for REAL values (e.g. 'NaN', '+Inf', '-Inf'), but well, those would be strings then (in a REAL column).
Postgresql actually knows 'NaN', 'Infinity' and '-Infinity' but only if there is a real or double precision operand next to the value. NUMERIC does not work with any of the special values.
As of now, the postgresql connector uses strings for binding.

MySQL and sqlite use binary bindings for prepared statements. Need to run tests if those work OK.

transaction isolation levels:
=================
Make them configurable?
Make them read/write in connections?

Do not set them in the transaction (as in sqlpp11-connector-sqlite3), that would violate separation of duties.

table_alias and CTE:
====================
 - Using just the name_tag to identify the table in column_t is too little information
 - Using the full underlying table type is too much.

Use the name_tag plus a hash of the underlying table. That should give enough safety.

tags:
=====
Instead of no_insert and no_update, use auto_increment.
Instead of has_default: Specify the default value.

The required information can be extracted from the new values.
In addition, it should be possible to start writing `create table` calls.

Dynamic queries:
================
*) Dynamic tables, columns, queries:
As mentioned before, this is not the main focus of the library, but the last few weeks have created a new opportunity for this. I actually realized this when reading your mail:

You can now introduce new data types very easily (much easier than in sqlpp11). With a couple of meta functions and a bit of code in the connector library you're ready to go.

Then, instead of saying this column is of type int64_t, you could say, it is of type std::variant<in64_t, std::string_view, date, time, etc>.

This would make the use of this column very flexible, but of course, the burden to make sure that you do not compare apples and oranges would be your task :-)

This leads to an interesting thought: A dynamic table in basically be a map of name<->variant_column.

case_when:
==========
sqlpp11 tries to be clever with NULL: if a column x was marked as trivial_is_null and you said
x == 0, it translates this into x IS NULL.

If you really are in that situation, you could say

case_when(q == 0).then(x.is_null()).else_(x == q)

Or you might want to say

case_when(cond).then(x == q).else_(true)

What about x == std::nullopt?
=============================
x == NULL is always false, even if `x IS NULL`

Value types:
============
sqlpp11 has types like integral, text, boolean, etc. The library needs to define in much detail
how these types interact.

sqlpp17 simply uses whatever type you want.

to_string instead of operator<<
===============================
Might be faster (no funny stream buffering).
Certainly easier to use (string streams in particular need to be cleaned before re-use, which has proven to be annoying in testing)


Selectable:
===========
operators +-/*% are must not be in selectable expressions. That avoids all the type nonsense, i.e. what is the value type of adding two ints? int? long? SQL says long, C++ says int, for instance.

Member functions:
=================
like, is_null, is_not_null, in, not_in:

Three options:
  - create some CRTP base class that offers such functions
	  drawback: Inheritance.
  - make them free functions in general
	  This has the drawback that the syntax looks unfamiliar in comparison to SQL
	- make them member functions of column and some transparent expr-wrapper.
	  This way, we do not have to inherit all operators into all expressions.

Well, that should be an easy decision :-)

char:
=====
How to serialize char? integral or character?

I tend to consider char = text


Columns and tables:
===================
#warning: To check if all columns are correct, we should compare provided and required columns
#warning: (column being defined by TableSpec and ColumnSpec).

Difficult decision:
Tables and alias tables are defined by name and columns.
Columns /could/ be defined by tables and column specifications.
In that case they could uniquely identified. However, it would require
columns types to contain the table type, which contains all column
specifications.
Thus, `select(all_of(tab))` would contain all columns, each of which
would contain all column specs. This is quadratic in the number of
columns. That seems non-sustainable.

It seems more reasonable to just store the tables spec in the column
type and then look for required and provided columns.

Now, this would allow for

```
select(foo.id).from(bar.as(foo))
```

if `bar` happens to have an `id` column like `foo`.

While this construed example looks bad, I believe it is rather unlikely to happen.
I am therefore willing to risk that in favor of quadraticly growing type names.


No "dynamic_select" et al.
==========================
For dynamically selected columns, we can use optional, see below.
For dynamically joined tables, we can use optional, too.
For dynamic conditions, we can
  - use variants of true_type and some boolean expression
	  (optional is not useful here, because `A and NULL` should be what is expected in SQL: NULL
	- serialize stuff to strings with value types to join expressions together at will.

vector of variants, pros and cons:
----------------------------------
There was the idea of dynamically selecting columns using a vector of variants of potential candidate columns.

We could add any number of these in a vector.

Pros:
- we could dynamically select ANY number of columns
- we could use ANY name
- access in vector or map pattern

Cons:
- very different interface from the static one
- values need to be anonymized (type-erased) -> statement cannot be used for more than one db
- we could get index/name wrong when obtaining results
- we could get the type wrong (bad_variant exception)

Using optional for those things that are optional but static in nature:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Columns can be optional in a select, but they themselves are static.
Tables can be optional in a join, but they themselves are static.

Most of the time, anyway.

Thus, we could say something like :

    select(t.foo, wantBar ? f.bar : std::nullopt))
        .from(t.join(wantBar ? f : std::nullopt).on(t.fId = f.id)))
        .unconditionally();

All compile time checks are made as if all conditionals actually hold a value.
Optional columns will always yield NULL (no database interaction).
Optional joins will not be serialized

providing flags and columns:
============================
select(all_of(t)).flags(sqlpp::distinct)...

or

select(sqlpp::distinct).columns(all_of(t))...

or

select().flags(sqlpp::distinct).columns(all_of(t))...

The nicest way would still be to just say

select(sqlpp::distinct, all_of(t))...

That also happens to be the hardest way to do it (haven't found a nice solution yet)

row.x should be a value/optional, not a complex object.
=======================================================
auto x = row.x leads to too many surprises

results.front() needs to throw is results.empty()
=================================================
It happens way too often that someone assumes that there is at least one result, when there isn't

Instead of having a "custom_statement", combine statements with operator<< or similar

Braces:
=======
Use braces only if needed, e.g. not for "x and y and z" but for "(x or y) and z". Same with +-*/.

Actually, quite simple: no braces for chaining "same" operators, any other combination requires braces.

Invert the logic from sqlpp11: Instead of expressions writing braces for themselves, request braces for subexpressions where they might be required.

TrivialIsNull:
==============
This was one of the most controversial ideas in sqlpp11.

Today, I agree with the critics: this requires the library to do so much "magic", it is just confusing.

Custom statements:
==================
These can be created trivially by concatenating sub-statements.

Union:
======
"merge" field specs: if left can be null while right cannot, then union can be null
union() takes two or more select statements (the member function could forward to a free function)

CTE:
====
CTEs can be self-referential. In order to do that, we need to know the columns of a CTE.

Thus, we need to create the non-recursive part first and then union-all with the second part.


MYSQL:
======
MySQL requires three resources to be managed:

a) mysql_library_init/mysql_library_end:
   These are not thread safe.
	 => Provide an RAII struct that can be used as a global static
	 => Even better: Provide a function with a static member that initializes that RAII struct
b) mysql_thread_init/mysql_thread_end
   These must be called once per thread
	 => Offer thread local storage raii (this would be the default)
	 => Offer a way to turn off the thread local storage raii
c) new/delete MYSQL, mysql_init/mysql_close
   => offer a connection raii object

Offer a connection_view which takes a MYSQL connection pointer and assumes that it is initialized and threading is taken care of.


Auto-reconnect needs to be turned off by default. It is just too crazy.
Transactions are lost, session settings are lost, prepared statements are lost
